        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a Python implementation of the analytical framework presented in Schmitt (2026). The core of this repository is the iPython Notebook `taming_tail_risk_in_financial_markets_draft.ipynb`, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions to replicate the paper's findings. The pipeline addresses the critical challenge of **sequential risk control** in nonstationary financial markets, where standard VaR models often fail during structural breaks and volatility regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper proposes **Regime-Weighted Conformal Risk Control (RWC)**, a model-agnostic framework that wraps arbitrary quantile forecasters to ensure valid sequential risk control. This codebase operationalizes the proposed solution:\n",
        "-   **Validates** data integrity using strict schema checks and temporal consistency enforcement.\n",
        "-   **Engineers** regime features ($RV21$, $MAR5$) to capture market volatility and trend states.\n",
        "-   **Calibrates** VaR bounds using a novel weighting scheme that combines exponential time decay (recency) with kernel-based regime similarity.\n",
        "-   **Evaluates** performance via rigorous backtesting (Kupiec, Christoffersen) and regime-stratified stability metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented methods combine techniques from Financial Econometrics, Conformal Prediction, and Statistical Learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Sequential Risk Control Objective:**\n",
        "The goal is to construct a one-sided VaR bound $U_t(x_t)$ such that the conditional probability of exceedance is bounded by $\\alpha$:\n",
        "$$ \\mathbb{P}(y_t \\le U_t(x_t)) \\ge 1 - \\alpha $$\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Regime-Weighted Conformal (RWC):**\n",
        "RWC calibrates a safety buffer $\\hat{c}_t$ from past forecast errors $s_i = y_i - \\hat{q}_i$. Weights $w_i(t)$ are assigned based on recency and regime similarity:\n",
        "$$ w_i(t) \\propto \\underbrace{\\exp(-\\lambda(t-i))}_{\\text{Recency}} \\cdot \\underbrace{K_h(z_i, z_t)}_{\\text{Regime Similarity}} $$\n",
        "where $K_h$ is a Gaussian kernel measuring the distance between regime embeddings $z$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Weighted Quantile Calibration:**\n",
        "The buffer $\\hat{c}_t$ is computed as the weighted $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the past scores:\n",
        "$$ \\hat{c}_t := Q_{1-\\alpha}^{\\tilde{w}(t)}(\\{s_i\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}_t}) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Effective Sample Size (ESS) Safeguard:**\n",
        "To prevent variance explosion when localizing to rare regimes, the algorithm monitors the effective sample size $n_{\\text{eff}}(t)$. If $n_{\\text{eff}}(t) < n_{\\min}$, it falls back to time-only weighting (TWC).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided iPython Notebook (`taming_tail_risk_in_financial_markets_draft.ipynb`) implements the full research pipeline, including:\n",

        "-   **Modular, Multi-Task Architecture:** The pipeline is decomposed into 23 distinct, modular tasks, each with its own orchestrator function.\n",
        "-   **Configuration-Driven Design:** All study parameters (grids, splits, hyperparameters) are managed in an external `config.yaml` file.\n",
        "-   **Rigorous Data Validation:** A multi-stage validation process checks schema integrity, temporal monotonicity, and return plausibility.\n",
        "-   **Deterministic Execution:** Enforces reproducibility through seed control, strict causality checks, and frozen parameter sets.\n",

        "-   **Reproducible Artifacts:** Generates structured results containing raw time-series, aggregated metrics, and robustness sweep data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology Implemented\n",
        "\n",
        "The core analytical steps directly implement the methodology from the paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Configuration & Validation (Task 1):** Loads and validates the study configuration, enforcing parameter constraints and reproduction modes.\n",
        "2.  **Data Ingestion & Cleansing (Tasks 2-3):** Validates CRSP schema, enforces strict monotonicity, and handles missingness.\n",
        "3.  **Loss Construction (Task 4):** Computes portfolio loss $y_t = -r_t^{\\text{port}}$ and enforces causality contracts.\n",
        "4.  **Data Splitting (Task 5):** Partitions data into Train, Validation, and Test sets based on chronological boundaries.\n",
        "5.  **Feature Engineering (Tasks 6-7):** Computes and standardizes regime features ($RV21$, $MAR5$) using pre-test statistics.\n",
        "6.  **Base Forecasting (Tasks 9-10):** Generates quantile forecasts using Historical Simulation (HS) and Gradient Boosting (GBDT).\n",
        "7.  **Conformal Calibration (Tasks 11-14):** Applies SWC, TWC, RWC, and ACI wrappers to calibrate VaR bounds.\n",
        "8.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (Task 15):** Optimizes parameters ($m, \\lambda, h$) on the validation set.\n",
        "9.  **Execution (Task 16):** Runs the final optimized models on the full test set.\n",
        "10. **Evaluation (Tasks 17-20):** Computes headline metrics, regime stability, backtests, and weight diagnostics.\n",
        "11. **Robustness Analysis (Task 22):** Conducts a bandwidth ablation sweep to verify the bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
        "12. **Final Audit (Task 23):** Verifies methodological invariants and compares results against paper benchmarks.\n",

        "Risk forecasts drive trading constraints and capital allocation, yet losses are nonstationary and regime-dependent. This paper studies sequential one-sided VaR control via conformal calibration. I propose regime-weighted conformal risk control (RWC), which calibrates a safety buffer from past forecast errors using exponential time decay and regime-similarity weights from regime features. RWC is model-agnostic and wraps any conditional quantile forecaster to target a desired exceedance rate. Finite-sample coverage is established under weighted exchangeability, and approximation bounds are derived under smoothly drifting regimes. On the CRSP U.S.\\ equity portfolio, time-weighted conformal calibration is a strong default under drift, while regime weighting can improve regime-conditional stability in some settings with modest conservativeness changes.\n"

        "\n",
        "Unlike standard Conformal Prediction (CP), which assumes exchangeability, or Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI), which adjusts the target miscoverage level, RWC adapts the **calibration distribution** itself. It achieves this via a weighting scheme that prioritizes both **recency** (to handle drift) and **regime similarity** (to handle recurring market states, such as high-volatility crises).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Problem Formulation & Motivation**\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Core Problem:**\n",
        "Financial returns $(x_t, y_t)$ are non-exchangeable. The conditional distribution of losses $y_t | x_t$ shifts over time (drift) and exhibits regime-switching behavior (e.g., calm vs. stress periods).\n",
        "1.  **Standard VaR models** (e.g., Historical Simulation, GARCH) often fail to calibrate correctly during structural breaks, leading to excessive exceedances (risk violations) during crises.\n",
        "2.  **Standard Conformal Prediction** guarantees validity only under exchangeability, which is violated here.\n",
        "3.  **Existing Solutions:** Methods like ACI (Gibbs & Candès, 2021) react to failures by adjusting the target $\\alpha$, but they do not explicitly leverage the *structure* of market regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:**\n",
        "Construct a sequential one-sided VaR bound $U_t(x_t)$ such that:\n",
        "$$ \\mathbb{P}(y_t \\le U_t(x_t)) \\ge 1 - \\alpha $$\n",
        "where $\\alpha$ is the target risk level (e.g., 0.01 for 99% VaR), maintaining stability across different volatility regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Methodology: Regime-Weighted Conformal (RWC)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed method, RWC, constructs a safety buffer $\\hat{c}_t$ added to a base quantile prediction $\\hat{q}_t$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. The Conformity Score:**\n",
        "$$ s_t := y_t - \\hat{q}_t $$\n",
        "A positive score implies the base model underpredicted the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. The Weighting Mechanism:**\n",
        "To calibrate $\\hat{c}_t$ at time $t$, the method assigns weights $w_i(t)$ to historical scores $s_i$ (where $i < t$) based on two factors:\n",
        "$$ w_i(t) \\propto \\underbrace{\\exp(-\\lambda(t-i))}_{\\text{Recency}} \\cdot \\underbrace{K_h(z_i, z_t)}_{\\text{Regime Similarity}} $$\n",
        "*   **Recency:** Exponential decay ($\\lambda$) handles gradual drift.\n",
        "*   **Regime Similarity:** A kernel $K_h$ (e.g., Gaussian) measures distance between regime embeddings $z$ (derived from realized volatility and returns). This localizes calibration to historically similar market conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. The Calibration:**\n",
        "The buffer $\\hat{c}_t$ is computed as the **weighted $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile** of the past scores using the normalized weights $\\tilde{w}_i(t)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. The Safeguard (Effective Sample Size):**\n",
        "Regime localization increases variance by reducing the effective sample size ($n_{\\text{eff}}$). The algorithm includes a fallback: if $n_{\\text{eff}}(t) < n_{\\min}$, it reverts to time-only weighting (TWC) to prevent instability due to insufficient data in the current regime.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Theoretical Guarantees**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper provides two distinct theoretical results:\n",
        "\n",
        "**A. Exact Finite-Sample Validity (Theorem 5.2):**\n",
        "Under the assumption of **Weighted Exchangeability**, the method guarantees exact marginal coverage. While financial data is not exactly exchangeable, this provides the probabilistic foundation for the weighting mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**B. Asymptotic Regime-Conditional Coverage (Theorem 5.4):**\n",
        "Under assumptions of smooth drift and Lipschitz continuity of the score distribution with respect to regimes, the coverage gap $\\varepsilon_t$ decomposes into:\n",
        "$$ \\varepsilon_t = O(L_z h) + O(L_t \\tau_t) + O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{eff}}(t)}}\\right) $$\n",
        "*   **$O(L_z h)$:** Bias from regime mismatch (controlled by bandwidth $h$).\n",
        "*   **$O(L_t \\tau_t)$:** Bias from time drift (controlled by effective memory $\\tau_t$).\n",
        "*   **$O(1/\\sqrt{n_{\\text{eff}}})$:** Variance/Estimation error.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Implication:* There is a fundamental bias-variance tradeoff. Tight localization (small $h$) reduces regime bias but increases variance (low $n_{\\text{eff}}$).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Empirical Evaluation**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setup:**\n",
        "*   **Data:** CRSP U.S. Equity Portfolio (1990–2024).\n",
        "*   **Target:** 99% VaR ($\\alpha = 0.01$).\n",
        "*   **Base Models:**\n",
        "    1.  **HS:** Historical Simulation (simple, slow to adapt).\n",
        "    2.  **GBDT:** Gradient Boosting Quantile Regression (flexible, adaptive).\n",
        "*   **Baselines:** Standard Windowed Conformal (SWC), Time-Weighted Conformal (TWC), Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Results:**\n",
        "1.  **TWC is a Strong Default:** Simple time-weighting (recency) corrects most calibration errors caused by drift, achieving $\\approx 1.09\\%$ exceedance with tight bounds.\n",
        "2.  **RWC Enhances Stability in Stress:**\n",
        "    *   When using the simpler **HS base model**, RWC significantly outperforms baselines in the highest volatility quintile (reducing exceedance from 3.71% to 2.86%).\n",
        "    *   When using the flexible **GBDT base model**, the gains are marginal because the base model already captures much of the regime dynamics.\n",
        "3.  **Conservativeness Tradeoff:** RWC tends to produce slightly tighter average bounds than ACI but may exhibit higher variance in bound width due to the effective sample size reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Critical Assessment & Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strengths:**\n",
        "*   **Formalization of Nonstationarity:** The paper rigorously decomposes the error sources in financial risk forecasting into time-drift and regime-shift components.\n",
        "*   **Practicality:** The inclusion of the $n_{\\text{eff}}$ safeguard makes this deployable in production; without it, kernel-based methods often explode in variance during rare regimes.\n",
        "*   **Model Agnosticism:** It works as a wrapper for any proprietary risk model (Black-box).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:**\n",
        "*   **Dependence on Base Model:** The marginal utility of RWC diminishes as the base forecaster becomes more sophisticated (e.g., GBDT).\n",
        "*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** Tuning the bandwidth $h$ and decay $\\lambda$ is non-trivial and requires careful validation to balance the bias-variance tradeoff described in Theorem 5.4.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Verdict:**\n",
        "This is a rigorous contribution to financial risk management. It demonstrates that while **Time-Weighted Conformal (TWC)** is likely sufficient for general purpose use due to its simplicity and robustness, **Regime-Weighted Conformal (RWC)** offers a necessary layer of protection for models that are structurally rigid or when strict adherence to risk limits during specific market regimes (e.g., high-volatility crashes) is mandated by regulation or investment mandate."
